# Install phpmyadmin
`sudo apt-get install phpmyadmin`

* For staring phpmyadmin you need to add all line at the bottom of apache2.conf file*
I'm using geany editor here

`sudo geany /etc/apache2/apache2.conf`
Add following line at the end of this file

#### Include /etc/phpmyadmin/apache.conf

# How to uninstall and install apache in Ubuntu.

Actully I'm getting following problem with solution with terminal output:

"This page isnâ€™t working
localhost is currently unable to handle this request.
HTTP ERROR 500"

I will discussie more about this error later. 

First we see how to uninstall apache2

(1) `apt-get remove packagename`

will remove the binaries, but not the configuration or data files of the package packagename. It will also leave dependencies installed with it on installation time untouched.

(2) `apt-get purge packagename` or `apt-get remove --purge packagename`

will remove about everything regarding the package packagename, but not the dependencies installed with it on installation. Both commands are equivalent.

(4) `apt-get autoremove`

removes orphaned packages, i.e. installed packages that used to be installed as an dependency, but aren't any longer. Use this after removing a package which had installed dependencies you're no longer interested in.

(5) `aptitude remove packagename` or `aptitude purge packagename (likewise)`

will also attempt to remove other packages which were required by packagename on but are not required by any remaining packages. Note that aptitude only remembers dependency information for packages that it has installed. 

`sudo apt-get autoremove`

E: The package geoip-database-extra needs to be reinstalled, but I can't find an archive for it.`

**For Solving above problem**
Start with

`sudo dpkg --remove --force-all hl1440lpr`

If that fails ...

# become root
`sudo -i`
`cd /var/lib/dpkg/info`
`rm -rf hl1440lpr*`

`dpkg --remove --force-remove-reinstreq hl1440lpr`

exit
Confirm apt-get is fixed

# should return no errors
`sudo apt-get update`

# Got Solution For geoip
  `sudo add-apt-repository universe`

# Then i run this command
`sudo apt-get install geoip-database-extra`
